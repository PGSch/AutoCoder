# AutoCoder: Automated Code Generation from GitHub Issues

**AutoCoder** is a powerful tool that automates the process of generating code based on issue descriptions using **GitHub Actions** and **OpenAI’s GPT technology**. The primary objective is to streamline the development workflow for developers by allowing them to automatically generate code snippets, functions, or even entire modules directly from GitHub issues.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Leverages ChatGPT to understand natural language descriptions within GitHub issues and convert them into executable code.
- **Customizable Code Generation**: Users can customize the generated code by providing specific commands or detailed descriptions within the issue.
- **Automated Pull Request Creation**: After generating the code, AutoCoder automatically creates a pull request containing the generated code for easy review and integration.
- **Enhanced Productivity**: This tool is ideal for teams seeking to:
  - Prototype features quickly.
  - Automate repetitive coding tasks.
  - Maintain consistent coding standards across repositories.

## Future Enhancements

Future development plans include:

- **Support for Additional Programming Languages**: Expand the range of supported languages to accommodate various projects and coding standards.
- **Improved Natural Language Capabilities**: Enhance the language model’s ability to handle more complex code generation scenarios.

With AutoCoder, development teams can significantly reduce manual coding efforts and focus on building innovative solutions.
